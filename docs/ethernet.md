#### Arduino Ethernet Shield




This [Ethernet Shield](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoEthernetShield) which is based on the [Wiznet](https://www.wiznet.io/) [W5100](https://www.wiznet.io/) [Ethernet Chip](https://www.wiznet.io/) gives you an easy way to get your
Arduino Online.
It is directly supported by official Ethernet Library. It adds a micro-SD card slot, which can be used to store
files for serving over the network.

#### Arduino Ethernet Shield R2.0


The [Arduino Ethernet shield](http://www.nkcelectronics.com/arduino-ethernet-shield.html) (This item is Ethernet shield R2) allows an Arduino board to connect to a LAN
using the Ethernet library.
TCP/IP stack on board provided by the [W5100 chip](https://www.wiznet.io/)


#### Arduino Ethernet Shield R3.


The [Arduino Ethernet Shield R3.0](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-ethernet-shield-2) allows an Arduino board to connect to the internet. It is based on the
